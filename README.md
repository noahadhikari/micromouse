# MMv3

MMv3 is the 3rd generation robot platform used to teach the IEEE Micromouse DeCal at UC Berkeley. It was designed with usability, manufacturability, size, and cost in mind.

## Setup

1. Follow the assembly instructions in [lab1](docs/lab1.md) using the latest **BOM**.
2. Plug mouse into your computer and upload the latest **firmware.uf2** (see [releases](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/)) by dragging the file into the `RPI-RP2` folder that shows up. It should disappear and reappear as a `CIRCUITPY` folder.
    * If you've uploaded firmware before, you'll need to hold the `BOOTSEL` button on the Pi Pico while plugging in.
3. Download the latest CircuitPython [libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) (Bundle for Version 7.x) and upload the following ones to the lib/ folder on your mouse.
    * adafruit_motor/
    * adafruit_onewire/
    * neopixel.mpy

## Labs

Skeleton lab code, lab documents, and solutions are stored in [labs/](labs/), [docs/](docs/), and [solutions/](solutions/), respectively. To get started with a lab, simply copy the contents of the folder over to the CircuitPython drive and edit files from there.
